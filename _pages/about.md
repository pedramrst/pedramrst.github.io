Introduction
======
Hi! I am a Computer Science MSc student at the University of Tehran, specializing in large language models, model compression, and deep learning. My passion lies in advancing natural language processing (NLP) and developing efficient techniques for training and inference in large-scale models.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on large model compression techniques, including Quantization and Pruning, as well as Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods. I am also deeply interested in a wide range of NLP topics, such as language modeling, machine translation, and more. Additionally, I have a growing interest in the field of explainable AI.

Academic Background
======
I received my MSc in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from the University of Tehran, under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Javad Dousti. During my MSc, I focused on compression techniques for large language models and multilingual machine learning models. Prior to that, I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Ehsan Nazerfard, gaining expertise in data mining and recommendation systems.
